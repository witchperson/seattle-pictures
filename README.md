This is a seed project to build out a mock, simpler version of the profile module of Instagram.com.
There are CSS classes available to style the components, and the users will need to break down the application into a component heirarchy in order to apply these classes to the components correctly.

The point is to be able to identify trees of components in order to build them out into reusable, modular components. It will be a lot more challenging than you think. 

## Sample
The profile page this repo has modeled after can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/BYfuE

## End Goal
This is our end result: https://imgur.com/a/1Fazs
It does not use any icons since the official icons are trademarked.

## Components
### Navbar
The navigation bar is more challening than you think! It contains a hierarchy that leads to 8 components
### Content
The content view includes the profile header as well as the gallery. This will be the most challenging part.
### Footer
The Footer also consists of many elements.

## Modular Components
Think of each of your component as lego blocks. Some are the foundation on which other blocks stand on, while some are purely presentational.
